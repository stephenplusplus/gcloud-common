## I'm using a key from the Developer's Console, but getting: `Your private key is in an unexpected format and cannot be used. Please try again with another private key.`

There are many types of keys that can be created through the Developer's Console. The one gcloud expects is one for a "Service account".

See "I'm not using Compute Engine. What do I need to do?" from the [FAQ](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/gcloud-node/#/faq) for detailed steps on how to create and obtain a JSON key.
